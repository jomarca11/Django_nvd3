The tone of the fruit seems to shift between a tart rhubarb and a slightly candied quality. Cherry notes show on the lean and dry back end.€Private Collection€84€12.0€Judean Hills€€€Merlot€Carmel€161.0
150523€150523€Israel€Opens with solid grape and red-currant fruit accented by tobacco, but on the palate the wine is light for a Petite Sirah, usually a hefty wine. As the fruit is from very young vines, it's not a terrible surprise, and it's a positive sign that Israeli winemakers are stretching their horizons. Finishes tart-sweet, with red berry fruit and a hint of licorice.€Valley Wines€83€9.0€Shomron€€€Petite Sirah€Carmel€212.11111111111111
150540€150540€Israel€Shows lean red berry and herb aromas. Mild tea and currant flavors play on the tongue, but the desired weight and texture of Shiraz aren't there. Finishes short, with a tea note.€Vineyards Selected€82€12.0€Shomron€€€Shiraz€Carmel€157.16666666666666
150558€150558€Israel€The nose offers earthy, medicinal notes on the light black-cherry fruit. Thin on the palate, it has a cough syrup-like taste. The tannins are soft, the acids low. Finishes short.€Reserve€80€19.0€Galil€€€Cabernet Sauvignon€Barkan€96.84210526315789
